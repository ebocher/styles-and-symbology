== Requirements Classes for Advanced fills

[[rc-hatches]]
=== Requirements Class "Hatch fills"
==== Overview

This requirements class adds capabilities for defining hatch fills as a pattern of lines controlled by:
• the width of the line (i.e. thickness)
• the distance between two lines
• the angle of the lines

class Fill <<extended>>
Fill : hatch: Hatch

Hatch : width: float
Hatch : angle: float
Hatch : distance: float

[[rc-dotpattern]]
=== Requirements Class "Dotpattern fills"
==== Overview

[#img-uml-dotpatterns]
.Dotpattern Fills UML Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
class Fill <<extended>>
Fill : dotpattern: Dotpattern
Fill *-- Dotpattern

Dotpattern : distance: Distance
Dotpattern *-- Distance

Distance : horizontal: float
Distance : vertical: float
....

This requirements class extends Fill capabilities by adding support for dot fills with a point-based pattern.

[[rc-stipples]]
=== Requirements Class "Stipple fills"
==== Overview

This requirements class adds support for stipple fills. A stipple fill is a pattern of dots defined by a ratio property.

class Fill <<extended>>
Fill : stipple: Stipple
