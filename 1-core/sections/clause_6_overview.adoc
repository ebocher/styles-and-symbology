== Overview

This Standard defines conformance classes for:

* a core symbology conceptual and logical model based on Styles as a list of StylingRules consisting of a Symbolizer and optional Selector Expression (<<rc-core,Section 7>>),
* additional conformance classes extending this core model with:
   ** basic portrayal capabilities of vector features (<<rc-vector,Section 8>>),
   ** portrayal capabilities of coverage data (<<rc-coverage,Section 9>>),
   ** label placement and font outlines capabilities (<<rc-labels,Section 10>>),
   ** advanced strokes capabilities, including dashed lines, casing and centerlines (<<rc-dashes,Section 11>>),
   ** advanced fill capabilities, including hatches and stipples (<<rc-hatches,Section 12>>),
   ** using expressions as parameter values for any symbolizer properties, using identifiers in the right side of operation expressions, conditional expressions and variables (<<rc-parameter-values,Section 13>>),
   ** arithmetic and text relation operators (<<rc-arithmetic,Section 14>>),
   ** function call expressions and standardized functions mathematics, temporal and array relations, as well as text manipulation (<<rc-functions,Section 15>>), and
* two encodings for the logical and conceptual model covering all of these conformance classes:
   ** an encoding based on JSON that can be readily parsed by JSON parser (<<rc-json,Section 16>>), and
   ** a more expressive encoding based on Web CSS which is better suited to hand-edit styles (<<rc-cscss,Section 17>>).

In addition, the following annexes are included:

* a normative Abstract Test Suite for the conformance classes (<<annex-ats,Annex A>>),
* an informative mapping of SLD/SE and notable vendor extensions to the conceptual model and requirements classes (<<annex-sldse,Annex B>>),
* an informative map gallery of practical use cases alongside the styles used to generate the maps encoded in the _Cartographic Symbology Cascading Style Sheets_ encoding (<<annex-mapgallery,Annex C>>), and
* an informative revision history (<<annex-revisions,Annex D>>).

We need new diagrams to illustrate the conformance classes and encoding and the fact that this is all included in this standard.

.The core model and its potential extensions

Figure 2 explains the relation between the core, the potential extensions, and their encodings. A community style extension must be based on a core element and will be encoding-independent. An extension should have a concrete encoding. As the figure shows encoding could be implemented in various formats.
