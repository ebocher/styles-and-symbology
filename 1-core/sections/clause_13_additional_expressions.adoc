== Requirements Classes for Additional expressions

[[rc-parameter-values]]
=== Requirements Class "Symbolizer Parameter Value Expressions"
==== Overview

This requirements class adds support for using **ParameterValues** i.e., arbitrary **Expressions** (not only literals), for all **Symbolizer** properties.

==== Requirements

include::../requirements/rc-parameter-values.adoc[]

[[rc-righthand]]
=== Requirements Class "Any right-hand operands"
==== Overview

This requirements class removes the restriction that right-hand side operands of RelationExpressions are limited to LiteralExpressions.
For expressions encoded using CQL2, it is analogous to the _CQL2 Property-Property comparison_ requirements class.

[[rc-conditional]]
=== Requirements Class "Conditional Expressions"
==== Overview

==== Conditional expressions

abstract class Expression
ConditionalExpression --|> Expression
ConditionalExpression : condition: Expression
ConditionalExpression : thenExp: Expression
ConditionalExpression : elseExp: Expression
ConditionalExpression *-- Expression

| Name        | Definition                                     | Type          | Multiplicity
| condition   | Condition                                      | Expression    | 1
| thenExp     | Expression resolving to when condition is true | Expession     | 1
| elseExp     | Expression resolving to when condition is false| Expession     | 1

[[rc-variables]]
=== Requirements Class "Variables"
==== Overview

[#img-uml-class-variable-expression]
.Variable Expressions UML Class Diagram
[plantuml, target=diagram-classes, format=png]
....
abstract class Expression
VariableExpression --|> Expression
VariableExpression : name: string
....

This requirements class adds support for defining variables that can be used
to facilitate re-use of definitions in encodings, as well as to provide configurable
elements that can be associated with application control such as a slider or drop-down control.

===== Variable expressions
.VariableExpression class
[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
| Name        | Definition                                     | Type          | Multiplicity
| name        | Name of the variable                           | string        | 1
|===

// __NOTE:__ Consider adding a member and array element access expression
