== Requirements Classes for additional coverage styling capabilities

[[rc-coverage-as-points]]
=== Requirements Class "Coverage as points"

==== Overview

This requirements class adds the capability to render a coverage as individual points, as if it were a MultiPoint vector feature, using a marker.

This requirements class adds the capability to transform a coverage into a feature collection.

// add an example with windbarbs (see https://docs.geoserver.org/main/en/user/styling/css/styledmarks.html)

[rc-coverage-as-contours]
=== Requirements Class "Coverage as contours"

==== Overview

This requirements class adds the capability to render a coverage as contours, as if it were a MultiLineString or MultiPolygon vector feature, using a fill and/or stroke.

// add an example (contour) as hypsometric tints (see https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/drawing-color-hillshade-a-tutorial-with-time-lapse-videos)

and the brightest color is stretched to white, with all colors in between stretched out
linearly
| histogram         | Stretches the contrast based on a histogram of how many
colors are at each brightness level on input, with the goal of producing equal number of
pixels in the image at each brightness level on output
