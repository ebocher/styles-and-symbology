# OGC Cartographic Symbology

This repository hosts the working draft documents for the multi-part OGC Cartographic Symbology Standard. **Part 1: Core model and encodings** is available as [HTML](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) or [PDF](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.pdf) and is to be considered version **2.0** of "SymCore".
The following extensions are also planned:

- Part 2: Model extension for graphical shapes and transformations
- Part 3: Model extension for geometry relations and manipulation
- Part 4: Model extension for additional coverage symbolization

In comparison to the current _OGC Symbology Conceptual Model: Core Part ("SymCore")_ version 1.0, the new draft candidate Standard aims to better reflect its classification as an OGC Implementation Standard by including the requirements classes needed to enable the implementation of interoperable ***encodings***, ***renderers*** (e.g., [_OGC API - Maps_](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps/) / [_OGC API - Tiles_](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-tiles)) and systems ***parsing*** and/or ***generating*** style definitions (e.g., [_OGC API - Styles_](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-styles/), visual style editors, style transcoders).

It does so by featuring:
- A **modular logical and conceptual model** for styling capabilities,
- A [**minimal Core**](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#toc20) requirements class including clear extension mechanisms, through the definition of abstract _Selectors_, _Symbolizers_, and _Expressions_,
- a basic [**Vector Styling**](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#toc23) requirements class,
- a basic [**Coverage Styling**](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#toc26) requirements class,
- requirements classes providing additional styling functionality,
- [**CartoSym-JSON, a JSON encoding**](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) of the conceptual and logical model facilitating machine readability,
- [**CartoSym-CSS, a CSS-inspired encoding**](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) of the conceptual and logical model facilitating hand-editing.

_The current **published** version of OGC Symbology Conceptual Model: Core Part (SymCore) **1.0** is available in [HTML](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-067r3/18-067r3.html) or [PDF](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-067r3/18-067r3.pdf)._

## Part 1 Requirements classes

### Basic portrayal capabilities
- a [core symbology conceptual and logical model](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#toc20) based on Styles as a list of Styling Rules consisting of a Symbolizer and optional Selector Expression,
- basic [vector styling](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#toc23) (including fills, strokes, and markers supporting text, image or dot graphics)
- basic [coverage styling](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html#toc26) (including mapping fields to a color, alpha or single channel and applying a colormap),
- basic [labeling](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) (placement of labels supporting text, image or dot graphics)

### Common portrayal capabilities

- [hill shading](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [font outlines](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [dashed strokes](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [stroke casing and center lines](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [hatch fills](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [stipple fills](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html)

### Additional Expression capabilities

- [expressions as parameter values](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) for any symbolizer properties,
- using [identifiers on the right side](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) of operation expressions,
- [conditional expressions](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [variables](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [arithmetic operators](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [text relation operators](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [function call expressions](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html),
- [array relations](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) standard functions,
- [text manipulation](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) standard functions,

### Encodings

- [CartoSym-JSON](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html) which can be readily parsed by a generic JSON parser.
CartoSym-JSON inherits and extends [CQL2-JSON](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html#cql2-json) for expressions used in selectors and parameter values.
See [example style sheet](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/blob/main/1-core/examples/2-vector-polygon.cs.json) and [JSON Schema](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/blob/main/1-core/schemas/CartoSym-JSON.schema.json).
- [CartoSym-CSS](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/18-067r4.html), a more expressive encoding inspired from Web CSS and other cartographic CSS-like styling languages (e.g., GeoCSS, CartoCSS, MapCSS, GNOSIS CMSS) which is better suited to hand-edit styles.
CartoSym-CSS inherits and extends [CQL2-Text](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-065r1.html#cql2-text) for expressions used in selectors and parameter values.
See [example style sheets](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/tree/main/1-core/examples) and ANTLR 4 BNF grammars for the [lexer](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/blob/main/1-core/schemas/CartoSym-CSS-Lexer.g4) and [parser](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/blob/main/1-core/schemas/CartoSym-CSS-Grammar.g4).

The following requirements classes are planned for the next parts of the standard:
